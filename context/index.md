## version control software

- Never use git add -A or git add . or checking to make sure only your changes are going to be included.
  - Always prefer running `git add <filename> <filename2>`.
- Commit message titles should be imperative, start capitalized, limited to 50 chars, and finish with no punctuation.
  - Bulletpoint lists and other markdown syntaxes are encouraged inside commit message descriptions.

## misc

- If you encounter difficulties running commands or tests, ask for help and relay the error messages to me.
  - I can always install any dependencies you need.
- If you detect a file has changed since you last saw it, match its new style or content instead of reverting it to what you last remember, as the humans (or other agents) probably made an edit to help you.
- Do not use large blocks of characters to atract attention like `==== THING ====`; they're ugly.

## personal

- Do not attempt to use GitHub's `gh` CLI nor Gitlab's `glab` unless explicitly told to do so.
